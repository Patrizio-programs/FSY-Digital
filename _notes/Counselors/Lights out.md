Teach your youth the importance of sleep. Teach them that they need a good
nightâ€™s sleep to feel the Spirit fully and to get the most out of the conference. If
participants are uncooperative, teach them principles and allow them to act for
themselves rather than getting angry or turning lights off for them.
Do not go to bed until all lights are out and your youth are asleep.
