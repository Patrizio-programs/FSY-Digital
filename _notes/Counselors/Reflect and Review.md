Some of the most powerful experiences during the week will come as you dis-
cuss the gospel with your participants through formal and informal opportunities.

Each evening you will lead your group in a 20-minute discussion called Reflect
and Review. The final Reflect and Review of the week will be with your entire
company, and you will lead this discussion with your co-counselor(s).
Unlike session-directing couple morningsides, Reflect and Review discussions
give the youth more opportunities to participate and allow them to learn on a
more personal level. Your job is not to present a lesson or a message; it is to
create a Spirit-filled environment and encourage the youth to reflect on and share
what they have learned and felt throughout the day.
Below are some suggestions to help you have a successful experience with
Reflect and Review:
• Prepare yourself and your youth to have a spiritual experience. Begin with
prayer, and consider singing a brief hymn together.
• Try to hold Reflect and Review in a place with few distractions, where the
Spirit can be present.
• Ask questions that inspire pondering, such as “What happened today that

was inspiring to you? What are you learning? Why did you find that mean-
ingful? How will that experience influence your life? What will you share

with your family?” You may want to begin by sharing a meaningful experi-
ence of your own.

• As youth respond, ask additional questions that encourage them to think
more deeply. Invite them also to comment on one another’s responses.
• Try not to take over the conversation; simply direct it as needed toward
gospel truths. Bear testimony as appropriate, and allow the Spirit to guide
the discussion to meet the needs of the youth.
After Reflect and Review, give any last-minute announcements or reminders to
your youth. After praying together as a group, encourage your participants to
return to their rooms and offer their personal prayers.
