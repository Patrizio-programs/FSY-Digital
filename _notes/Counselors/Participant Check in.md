Throughout participant check-in, give a positive first impression by being out-
going and friendly to excite the youth and give their parents confidence in the
program. Follow dress and appearance standards.
Arrive early and check in with the assistant coordinator in charge, who will
assign you a responsibility. You may be handing out materials or directing youth
where to go. Before check-in, help move any supplies or tables to the check-in
area and organize signs to help participants know where to go. Make sure all
participant ID cards and meal cards (if applicable) are alphabetized so lines flow
quickly and smoothly.

Help ensure that check-in starts on time.
As the youth go through the check-in line, quickly explain to them what each
item is.

Remind participants to keep their handbooks with them all week. Be friendly and
talk to the youth while they are in line, but keep the lines moving.
Any questions about on-site registration or room changes should be referred to
the coordinator at the solutions table.
Be flexible and offer additional help. Ask the supervising assistant coordinator
questions such as “What can I do now?” or “I have checked in all the participants.
Should I help take down tables?”

Frequently Asked Questions from Parents
Q: What do I do if my son or daughter needs to leave during the week?
A: The participant’s legal guardian needs to sign him or her out (and then back
in upon returning) at the site office. If it is not possible for the legal guardian to
come personally, another person may pick up a participant only after provid-
ing written consent from the legal guardian and a photocopy of the guardian’s
official signed identification.
Q: May I have a program schedule?
A: No. First, we order only enough for the participants. Second, for security
reasons, we do not allow people not connected with FSY to take a program
schedule.
Q: Medical questions
A: Direct participants to the health counselors. They have records of all partici-
pants and their medical needs.
Typical issues that should be directed to the coordinators at the solu-
tions table:

• My friend and I registered together, but now we aren’t roommates.
• I am in the wrong age-group.
• My friend just registered for FSY. Can we be in the same company or room?

If there is any doubt in your mind about the answer to these or other questions,
send participants to the solutions table.
