Determine who will lead this portion of family home evening at co-counselor
planning (One counselor of the company leads this and the other counselor assists).
After family home evening games, give a brief testimony of the importance of setting goals
in our daily lives and how it can keep us on the path to return to our Father in Heaven.
Encourage discussion regarding goals, and have the
youth choose what they want to work on as a company. Refer to the company
commitments and goal setting pages in the participant handbook for assistance.
Also include in your discussion any objectives mentioned by the session-directing
couple during the family home evening lesson. Company goals could include
memorizing a scripture, giving compliments, thanking each other, or taking notes
in classes.
After setting a few company goals, give the youth time to set their own personal
goals for the week. These should be goals they can complete during the week of
FSY. Follow up on these goals each morning at gospel study.
