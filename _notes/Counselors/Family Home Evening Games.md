Meet in your company spot to play any of the following games with your com-
pany. Some of the fun comes from playing a game multiple times. There is no

need to play the games quickly or move on if the youth are enjoying one partic-
ular game.

Make sure you leave time following each game to conduct a “debriefing,” in

which the company discusses connections between the game and gospel prin-
ciples. If you are able to play only one game because a good discussion has

ensued, that is fine.

Games:

Aura: Participants get into pairs and face each other. Pairs place their palms
together, with hands at about shoulder height. Both of them close their eyes,
pull their palms apart (approximately 30 cm), and then turn around in place
three times. Their goal is to then reach their hands out and try to touch palms
while keeping their eyes closed the whole time.

Mumble Jumble: Before the activity begins, a counselor cuts up a few pic-
tures into puzzle pieces and places them in a bag or other container. Each

participant grabs a puzzle piece from the bag, keeping the piece secret until
the counselor says, “Go!” At this point, the participants try to locate the other
members of the group with the appropriate pieces to complete the puzzle.
Whichever group completes their puzzle first wins. This is a good activity for
breaking into smaller groups so more youth can talk during the debriefing.
Stinger: Have group members stand in a circle and close their eyes. A
counselor circles the group and secretly selects one “stinger” by squeezing
an individual’s shoulder. The group members then open their eyes and begin
mingling and introducing themselves to others while shaking hands (and
trying to spot the stinger). Meanwhile, the stinger tries to eliminate everyone
without getting caught. The stinger eliminates others by “injecting poison”
into their wrists with an index finger while shaking hands. A person who is
stung may not “die” until at least five seconds after he or she is stung. The
more dramatic the death, the better!

When someone is ready to guess the stinger’s identity, he or she should an-
nounce the desire to make a guess. Within 10 seconds, a second person must

also express a desire to make a guess; if no other players desire to do so, the
mingling continues and no guesses can be made until after another person
“dies.” If within 10 seconds, a second person does express the desire to guess,
the two of them may make an accusation together. On the count of three,
both point to whomever they think is the stinger. If they do not point to the

same person, or they both point to the wrong person, they are both automat-
ically dead. If they both select the correct person, the stinger is dead and the
game is over.

Hagoo: Separate the group into two even teams, and have the teams stand
shoulder to shoulder in two parallel lines facing each other. The two lines
should be about one meter apart. The two players at the opposite end of each
line are opponents. They step out of their lines so they are facing each other
and looking down the middle of the two rows. They will both say, “Hagoo,”
and then start to walk down the row toward each other. They must not break
eye contact, and their object is to get to the opposite end of the line without
laughing or smiling. As the players pass each other, they must continue to
maintain eye contact by walking backwards. If a person breaks eye contact,
laughs, or smiles, he or she must then join the end of the line of the opposing
team instead of rejoining his or her own team’s line. The teams can do or say
any silly things to make the opposing player crack up, but they must be careful
not to make their own player lose concentration. The teams may not touch
another player. This process continues until everyone has had a turn. The team
with the most players at the conclusion of the game wins.
