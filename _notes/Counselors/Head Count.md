Conducting a head count each night ensures that all participants are accounted
for and safe. As soon as you get back to your rooms each evening, instruct your
participants to stay in their rooms and remind them to shut windows and close

blinds. After you verify that all your youth are in their rooms, inform your
assistant coordinator.

On day one, fill out a head-count sheet, if applicable, and turn it in to your
assistant coordinator. Each evening before you start Reflect and Review, give your
assistant coordinator a head count. After the first night, texting a message to your
assistant coordinator may be acceptable.
