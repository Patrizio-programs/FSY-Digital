Quiet time is scheduled each evening to allow the youth to prepare for bed and
wind down from the dayâ€™s activities by recording their thoughts and feelings
in their journals, reflecting on gospel discussions held throughout the day, and
spending a few additional minutes reading their scriptures.
Remind the youth that they will not have time to prepare for bed following
Reflect and Review. Also, teach them the importance of keeping a journal.
They will have many special experiences this week and will treasure their
journal if they keep a record of them. Encourage them to record activities and
their thoughts and feelings while the day is still fresh in their minds. This time
should not be used to text, make phone calls, or play electronic games.
